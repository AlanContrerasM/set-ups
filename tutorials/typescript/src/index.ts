//don't forget to install globally npm i -g typescript
//to compile on terminal tsc index
//we can also do it watch mode tsc --watch index
//to create the typscript config on terminal, tsc --init
//on the config we can for example edit the rootDir and outDir, and now we only call tsc to compile.


let id: number = 5;
// id = "4"; will throw error from both vs code and when compiling
