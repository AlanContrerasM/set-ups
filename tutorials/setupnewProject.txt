git clone githublink/webpack-demo


cp -a initfiles/. webpack-demo/
cd webpack-demo


npm init -y
eslint --init 
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env core-js regenerator-runtime webpack
npm install --save-dev jest
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli style-loader css-loader babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env core-js regenerator-runtime webpack jest babel-jest ts-jest eslint-config-prettier

//if eslint is installed globally, which it is in this computer. otherwise

//jest --init not necesary since config file copied from initial temp[late]


add the folowing to the extends object in .eslintrc.*
{
  "extends": [
    "some-other-config-you-use",
    "prettier"
  ]
}


in package.json delete 
  "main": "index.js",
and add
  "private": true,
This is so we don't accidentally publish it.






*we install lodash, this is optional, but delete import line in index.js
npm install --save lodash


inside package.json we can include npm scripts inside "scripts"
For example:
"build": "webpack --progress --mode=production",
"watch": "webpack --progress --watch --mode=production",
"watchdev": "webpack --progress --watch --mode=development",
"test": "jest" 
now we can run webpack and create the bundle with 
npm run build

ctrl + shit + p  >Format Document to pretify it

rails

create the rails project folder
on terminal
sudo rails new projectname

//to create controllers
rails g controller home index

//start server 
rails s
//it'll be on localhost:3000  and localhost/3000/home/index

//you can modify routes on config routes
//for example add the new route for root on the file
root 'home#index'

//you can edit on app/views/

//if you want to create more pages, create a ne .html.erb on the created home folder in views, add it to the home controller, and add it to routes

//create a scaffold, basically a model
rails g scaffold friends first_name:string last_name:string email:string phone:string twitter:string
//now create the schema, basically make the db live
rails db:migrate

//delete or comment out everything on new css files created with the scaffold, otherwise messes up with bootstrap

//localhost:3000/friends will have your db and you can edit out anything
//run rails routes if you want to see the routes created and from them create links

//to add authentication, and/or add gems
//search in google ruby gems, likely rubygems.org
//find devise, and you'll see the code for Copy Pasting to the GemFile on your project
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8' 
//run
bundle install
//from the gem library page on the rubygems.org go to the documentation and see the setup steps. 
//run the specified generator and also follow steps prompted, and continue doing the documentation steps
//replace MODEL for user
